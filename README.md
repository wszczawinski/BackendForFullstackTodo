# Backend API for Fullstack Todos Application
### JSON API created with Node and MongoDB

This todo list is another step on my way to creating full stack aplications. 
The goal is to create a fully working JSON API on the backend (Node, Express, MongoDB) and SPA frontend which will consume that API and interact with DB. 

The frontend part of this application can be found in this repo:
